# Lab2 Reflection - CS308 Programming Languages

This is my reflection after completing Lab 2 in the course CS308 Programming Languages at Fulbright University Vietnam in Spring22.

- **FSA and parse tree:** I am slow at deciding and drawing FSA and parse tree. The cheat sheet makes me be confused sometimes but thanks to Google, I can have a basic understanding of the special characters such as \*, ?, ^, etc.
- **Legal and customary Java Identifiers:** So far I have no confusion. Everything is clear enough for me to understand.
- **Numbers:** So far I have no confusion. Everything is clear enough for me to understand.
- **Arithmetic expressions:** This part is really challenging. I have tried for 2 days and came up with a solution that, to be honest, I do not really satisfy with. Basically, my solution can successfully identify the Java identifiers, integers, and floats and replace those terms with "X", "I", and "F", respectively. I also tested my solution with some test cases. However, I still have a feeling that there is some hidden cases my program cannot pass. I really appreciate if you professor can have a look at my submission and give some comments on it.
